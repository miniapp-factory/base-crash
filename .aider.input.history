+Code the following app
+```
+Create a lightweight match-3 mini-game inspired by Candy Crush, called Base Crash, themed around the Base ecosystem.
+Gameplay Requirements:
+Use a 6×6 grid of tiles.
+Tile types: Base logo, ETH, Gas, OPENX, Pepe.
+Allow swapping two adjacent tiles (horizontal or vertical).
+If the swap forms a line of 3 identical tiles → remove them, give points, drop new tiles from above.
+Match of 4 creates a Super Token clearing one full row.
+Match of 5 creates an Onchain Blast clearing a 3×3 area.
+Add a 60-second countdown timer.
+After the timer ends, show the final score with a “Play Again” button.
+Add a Share Score button (for Farcaster/X).
+UI / Style Requirements:
+Web3/Base theme (blue, white, neon tones).
+Simple animations (pop, fade, bounce).
+Clean and mobile-friendly layout.
+Technical Requirements:
+Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
+Keep the logic optimized and minimal.
+No backend or external services required.
+Extras:
+Implement a local leaderboard storing Top-10 scores.
+Keep the code well-structured and easy to read.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

+IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
+- The game must NEVER show empty spaces. After every match, tiles must always fall down correctly and new tiles must generate at the top without leaving gaps.
+- Ensure all DOM elements update properly at every step (swap, match, removal, falling, and refill).
+- Code must be clean, readable, and bug-free.
+
+GAME MECHANICS:
+- 6x6 grid.
+- Tile types: Base, OPENX, ETH, Gas, Pepe.
+- You may use emoji OR image files (base.svg, openx.svg, eth.svg, gas.svg, pepe.svg). If images are used, update the DOM with <img>.
+- Allow swapping two adjacent tiles (horizontal or vertical).
+- If the swap does not create a match, revert automatically.
+- Match-3 removes tiles and gives points.
+- Match-4 creates a “Super Token” that clears a full row.
+- Match-5 creates an “Onchain Blast” that clears a 3x3 area.
+- Continue match cascades until no matches remain.
+
+UI & FEATURES:
+- 60-second timer.
+- Real-time score display.
+- Local Top-10 leaderboard stored in localStorage.
+- “Share Score” button that copies text to clipboard.
+- Clean Base-themed UI (blue/white, minimal).
+- Mobile-friendly responsive design.
+- Smooth animations (pop, fade, drop).
+
+TECH NOTES:
+- Make the code well-organized and structured in a single index.html file.
+- Prevent any null, undefined, or empty tile values.
+- Ensure every tile always has a valid visual (emoji or image).
+- Ensure the refill logic works 100% reliably.
+
+FINAL GOAL:
+Deliver a fully working, clean, stable match-3 game with **zero empty cells**, ready for deployment in the OpenxAI x Base Mini-App Factory.
